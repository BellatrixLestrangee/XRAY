# Image Processing of X Ray Images
\Image Processing through Convolution Neural Network
I have built an Image Processing System for Digital X-Ray Images to study the lungs of a
person and predict if it is normal or infected with pneumonia. Also, if infected, the system
helps diagnose whether the infection is bacterial pneumonia or viral pneumonia.

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence in the field of computer science that
often uses statistical techniques to give computers the ability to &quot;learn&quot; (i.e., progressively
improve performance on a specific task) with data, without being explicitly programmed. Or
in other words, we train the algorithm with a set of data, and on the basis of the patterns
formed on the dataset, the algorithm helps in predicting a requisite data.

Project used Machine Learning and Deep Learning to build the algorithm for this project.
The dataset has various X-Ray images of the lungs. The normal chest X-ray depicts clear
lungs without any areas of abnormal opacification in the image. Bacterial pneumonia
typically exhibits a focal lobar consolidation, whereas viral pneumonia manifests with a more
diffuse ‘‘interstitial’’ pattern in both lungs. These are the patterns that the ML algorithm
builds on to make predictions on the test set.
